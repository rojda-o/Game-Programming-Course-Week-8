# Game-Programming-Course-Week-8
In the eighth week of the Game Programming course, I developed a 2D game with a focus on UI design and advanced game mechanics. The project includes features such as a dynamic scoring system, a lives display with sprites, and a "Game Over" sequence with a flicker effect. Players can restart the game with the "R" key, and a main menu provides a polished entry point to the gameplay. <br>

This project demonstrates the following fundamental skills:

- Creating and updating a real-time scoring system.
- Visualizing player lives using dynamic sprites.
- Implementing game-over logic with a flickering text effect.
- Using scene management to restart the game and navigate the main menu.

This project enhanced my understanding of Unityâ€™s UI tools, scripting, and scene management, while also refining my ability to create user-focused game features.
